Because there are multiple phenomena that can create a signal that looks similar to a planetary transit, the candidates have to be confirmed with another method. For Kepler-29 the planetary nature of the companions has been confirmed by transit timing variations, caused by other planets in the system, and a stability analysis. However, the mass of the planets is not well constrained yet.

Kepler-138 b is a Mars-sized object orbiting a red dwarf star about 200 light years from our solar system. Current measurements are consistent with a variety of compositions, and favor compositions that are mostly rock. All three planets orbiting Kepler-138 are close to their star and are most likely are too hot to be habitable.

The mass of the planet is not known, therefore one can only speculate about the planet's composition. If it is rocky, it could have liquid water on its surface. Kepler-186 orbits an M-dwarf, a star that is much cooler than the Sun. This is why the system's habitable zone is much closer to the star than in the Solar system.

These can be explained with a Jovian planet. However, because of the planet's short distance to the star, its density has to be more then 20 times that of Jupiter. The planet is most likely a remnant of a binary star which avoided complete destruction. The chemical composition, pressure and dimensions of the planet indicate that it is crystallized, or in other words, a very big diamond (Bailes et al 2011).	> 12.5000	1.210	1.400	< 0.5900	PSR 1719-14	PSR J1719-14 b	timing	PSR J1719-14

There is only one confirmed planet in the system, but a dynamical analysis suggests that they might be two planets locked in a 4:1 mean motion resonance.

It is the first microlensing planet found by analyzing data from only a single telescope. The planet is located beyond the snow-line. Some core accretion theories favor the formation of massive planets inside the snow-line. However, planetary migration in the protoplanetary disk might explain why the planet has moved outwards.

In the second, a 7.9 Earth-mass planet orbits a 71 Jupiter-mass brown dwarf at 2.1 AU, and in the third a 3.2 Earth-mass planet orbits a 26 Jupiter-mass brown dwarf at 0.94 AU.
